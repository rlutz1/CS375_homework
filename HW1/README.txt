# MATH375 HW 1 

## Prob1.m

This script goes step by step through the problem, all within the one script file.

All plotting uses the same `x` vector with `h` domain spacing. Screenshots for Part C when changing the domain spacing were taken after changing the value of `h` in the script directly and can be replicated as such.

The parts and some additional data are split into different figures.

### Figure 1

Taylor approximation of n = 2 against exact.

### Figure 2

Taylor approximations of n = 2, 4 against exact.

### Figure 3

Taylor approximations of n = 2, 4, 6 against exact. Added to illustrate that with more terms, the Taylor approximation does indeed get more accurate.

### Figure 4

Absolute error for approximations n = 2, 4.

### Figure 5 

Absolute error for approximations n = 2, 4, 6. Added to illustrate that with more terms, the Taylor approximation does indeed get more accurate.

### Figure 6

All exact and n = 2, 4 approximations plotted, along with the approximations' absolute error.
