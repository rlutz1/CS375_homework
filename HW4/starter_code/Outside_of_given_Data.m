%Fit a polynomial of degree 4 to the 5 points. In general, for n points, you can fit a polynomial of degree n-1 to exactly pass through the points.

%Evaluate the original function and the polynomial fit on a finer grid of points between 0 and 2.

%Plot the function values and the polynomial fit in the wider interval [0,2], with the points used to obtain the polynomial fit highlighted as circles. The polynomial fit is good in the original [0,1] interval, but quickly diverges from the fitted function outside of that interval.
